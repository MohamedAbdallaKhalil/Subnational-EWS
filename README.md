Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a subnational, multi-dimensional Early Warning System (EWS) for monitoring conflict escalation in Sudan. The system is designed as a Decision Support System (DSS) that produces interpretable, analyst-guided signals to support operational situational awareness, prioritization, and escalation review.

Features

Integrates seven complementary escalation indicators: intensity, lethality, diffusion, acceleration, volatility, dominance, and a composite escalation index.

Employs adaptive, region-specific thresholds to detect meaningful deviations from local baselines.

Generates multi-level alerts (normal, watch, warning, crisis) for structured decision support.

Designed for analyst-in-the-loop use, preserving human judgment and interpretability.

Supports subnational monitoring, capturing local dynamics in data-constrained environments.
